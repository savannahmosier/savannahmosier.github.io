    <h3>How I Got My Name</h3>
    <p>As a child, my mother was always told by my grandmother to name her child Savannah because she loved the movie Savannah Smiles. My mom never liked the name but when it came to being pregnant with twins, my mother and father agreed on each picking a name. Ironically enough, my father was the one who chose the name Savannah.</p>

      <h2>How I use my Smile</h2>
      <p>Five days a week I am blessed enough to work with children. However, working with children is not always easy. Through the difficult times, I remain with a smile on my face inorder to give each of my students a posotive role model and a few happy hours in thier day just incase they do not get to experience that elsewhere.</a>
